## Project Overview

This is a production-ready AI agent application built with:
- **LangGraph** for stateful, multi-step AI agent workflows
- **FastAPI** for high-performance async REST API endpoints
- **Langfuse** for LLM observability and tracing
- **PostgreSQL + pgvector** for long-term memory storage (mem0ai)
- **JWT authentication** with session management
- **Prometheus + Grafana** for monitoring

## Quick Reference: Critical Rules

### Import Rules
- **All imports MUST be at the top of the file** - never add imports inside functions or classes

### Logging Rules
- Use **structlog** for all logging
- Log messages must be **lowercase_with_underscores** (e.g., `"user_login_successful"`)
- **NO f-strings in structlog events** - pass variables as kwargs
- Use `logger.exception()` instead of `logger.error()` to preserve tracebacks
- Example: `logger.info("chat_request_received", session_id=session.id, message_count=len(messages))`

### Retry Rules
- **Always use tenacity library** for retry logic
- Configure with exponential backoff
- Example: `@retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(3), wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=4, max=10))`

### Output Rules
- **Always enable rich library** for formatted console outputs
- Use rich for progress bars, tables, panels, and formatted text

### Caching Rules
- **Only cache successful responses**, never cache errors
- Use appropriate cache TTL based on data volatility

### FastAPI Rules
- All routes must have rate limiting decorators
- Use dependency injection for services, database connections, and auth
- All database operations must be async

## Code Style Conventions

### Python/FastAPI
- Use `async def` for asynchronous operations
- Use type hints for all function signatures
- Prefer Pydantic models over raw dictionaries
- Use functional, declarative programming; avoid classes except for services and agents
- File naming: lowercase with underscores (e.g., `user_routes.py`)
- Use the RORO pattern (Receive an Object, Return an Object)

### Error Handling
- Handle errors at the beginning of functions
- Use early returns for error conditions
- Place the happy path last in the function
- Use guard clauses for preconditions
- Use `HTTPException` for expected errors with appropriate status codes

## LangGraph & LangChain Patterns

### Graph Structure
- Use `StateGraph` for building AI agent workflows
- Define clear state schemas using Pydantic models (see `app/schemas/graph.py`)
- Use `CompiledStateGraph` for production workflows
- Implement `AsyncPostgresSaver` for checkpointing and persistence
- Use `Command` for controlling graph flow between nodes

### Tracing
- Use LangChain's `CallbackHandler` from Langfuse for tracing all LLM calls
- All LLM operations must have Langfuse tracing enabled

### Memory (mem0ai)
- Use `AsyncMemory` for semantic memory storage
- Store memories per user_id for personalized experiences
- Use async methods: `add()`, `get()`, `search()`, `delete()`

## Authentication & Security

- Use JWT tokens for authentication
- Implement session-based user management (see `app/api/v1/auth.py`)
- Use `get_current_session` dependency for protected endpoints
- Store sensitive data in environment variables
- Validate all user inputs with Pydantic models

## Database Operations

- Use SQLModel for ORM models (combines SQLAlchemy + Pydantic)
- Define models in `app/models/` directory
- Use async database operations with asyncpg
- Use LangGraph's AsyncPostgresSaver for agent checkpointing

## Performance Guidelines

- Minimize blocking I/O operations
- Use async for all database and external API calls
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Use connection pooling for database connections
- Optimize LLM calls with streaming responses

## Observability

- Integrate Langfuse for LLM tracing on all agent operations
- Export Prometheus metrics for API performance
- Use structured logging with context binding (request_id, session_id, user_id)
- Track LLM inference duration, token usage, and costs

## Testing & Evaluation

The `evals/` framework has three runners sharing a common LLM-judge layer
(`evals/shared/`):

- **Trace eval** (`make eval`) — post-hoc scores unscored Langfuse traces with
  every metric prompt in `evals/metrics/prompts/`. Speaks the new
  `MultiAgentResponse` trace shape; legacy `messages` shape falls back cleanly.
- **Routing eval** (`make eval-routing`) — drives `coordinator._route` against
  an offline golden set in `evals/routing/golden.jsonl`. Multiset equality on
  delegated agent names; empty `expected_agents` means "answer directly".
- **Agent quality eval** (`make eval-quality AGENT=<name>`) — runs one
  specialist end-to-end via `agent.run()` and scores the output with its
  per-agent metric stack. Goldens in `evals/agent_quality/goldens/<name>.jsonl`.

Add new judge metrics by dropping a `<name>.md` into `evals/metrics/prompts/`.
Metrics where lower-is-better (`hallucination`, `toxicity`) are auto-flipped
during aggregation. Reports go to `evals/reports/<eval>_<timestamp>.json`.

## Configuration Management

- Use environment-specific configuration files (`.env.development`, `.env.staging`, `.env.production`)
- Use Pydantic Settings for type-safe configuration (see `app/core/config.py`)
- Never hardcode secrets or API keys

## 10 Commandments for This Project

1. All routes must have rate limiting decorators
2. All LLM operations must have Langfuse tracing
3. All async operations must have proper error handling
4. All logs must follow structured logging format with lowercase_underscore event names
5. All retries must use tenacity library
6. All console outputs should use rich formatting
7. All caching should only store successful responses
8. All imports must be at the top of files
9. All database operations must be async
10. All endpoints must have proper type hints and Pydantic models
11. All code must pass `make typecheck` (pyright standard mode)

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ Using f-strings in structlog events
- ❌ Adding imports inside functions
- ❌ Forgetting rate limiting decorators on routes
- ❌ Missing Langfuse tracing on LLM calls
- ❌ Caching error responses
- ❌ Using `logger.error()` instead of `logger.exception()` for exceptions
- ❌ Blocking I/O operations without async
- ❌ Hardcoding secrets or API keys
- ❌ Missing type hints on function signatures

## When Making Changes

Before modifying code:
1. Read the existing implementation first
2. Check for related patterns in the codebase
3. Ensure consistency with existing code style
4. Add appropriate logging with structured format
5. Include error handling with early returns
6. Add type hints and Pydantic models
7. Verify Langfuse tracing is enabled for LLM calls
